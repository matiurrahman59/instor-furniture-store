        "Description",
        "The seat's bowl-shaped bottom is adapted for your sit bones and those of most of the world's population. And with an innovative technique, the seat's padding is shaped to maximise your comfort. The upholstery of the chair consists of straight polyester fibres with small gaps between them – providing comfy elasticity and better ventilation so you enjoy a pleasant temperature when sitting. The backrest has a built-in lumbar support and the angle between the seat and the backrest is optimally adapted to make it comfortable for you to sit a little longer at the dining table. The hardwearing cover of cotton and polyester is yarn dyed to create an attractive two-tone effect. The chair cover comes in one piece and fixes in place with hook-and-loop fasteners so you can easily pull it off and put it back on again. After lively meals, it's nice to know that you can easily pull the chair cover off and machine wash it. The chair legs are made of solid wood, which is a durable natural material. Thanks to new research and a new technique, this upholstered chair gives you optimal seating comfort. Change the style anytime by replacing the chair cover with one in a different colour or model."
